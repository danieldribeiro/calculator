# Calculator

This document describes the project of a simple calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The calculator is a basic web application that allows users to perform simple mathematical calculations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, as well as input of integer and decimal numbers.

## Directory Structure
The project has the following directory and file structure:

* index.html: The HTML file that defines the structure of the calculator page.
* main.css: The CSS file that styles the calculator.
* index.js: The JavaScript file that controls the calculator's functionality.

## Features
The calculator offers the following features:

* Display of numbers and operators on the screen.
* Execution of mathematical calculations when the "=" button is pressed.
* Clearing the display when the "C" button is pressed.
* Restriction to allow only one decimal point and one operator per calculation.

## Usage
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the [Calculator](https://danieldribeiro.github.io/calculator/) file in a web browser.
2. Use the numbered buttons from 0 to 9 to input numbers.
3. Use operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to select the desired operation.
4. Press the "." button to add a decimal point if needed.
5. Click on the "C" button to clear the display.
6. When the expression is complete, press the "=" button to calculate the result.

## Restrictions
The calculator has the following restrictions:

* Only one operator can be used per calculation.

## Future Improvements
To enhance this project, you may consider the following additions:

* Support for trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.
* Allow input of negative numbers.
* Improve the user interface with a more appealing design.

## Conclusion
The calculator is a simple but functional project that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web application. This document provides an overview of the project, its features, and possible future improvements.
